# potato-disease-classification
A React Native mobile application which is used to classify the potato disease by using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow. This application also consists of ReactJs  application which runs on the web, gives the classification results based on the image uploaded by the user.

This application is very much useful for the farmers who will get a better idea about the yield in the potato field. 

It is a user friendly user interface, where the users have to just capture the picture of the potato leaf. The Deep learning model which is trained prior to classification, will be able to classify the given input image and give the class to which the potato leaf belongs to and the confidence for the prediction. 

Usually, Potato leaf will have three states, 1. Healthy, 2. Early Blight, 3. Late Blight. The classifier will provide the class mentioned above for each input image. The classes Early and Late blight will give less yield to the farmers as it is affected by some disease.
